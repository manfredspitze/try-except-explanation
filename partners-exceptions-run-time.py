# Python Exceptions

# An exception is an error that pops up when you run your script
# An exception will cause your script to crash
# As a programmer, you want to handle exceptions so that your script doesn't crash
# when Python 'throws' an exception
# Let the user know what went wrong when you handle exceptions in your script

# Uncomment each code block below one at a time and run it
# Notice what type of exception Python throws for each code block

# Example 1
# age = 35
# print(age.upper())  

# Example 2
# What happens if you enter 25?
# And what happens when you enter the word tiger?
# user_input = input("Enter a number:\n")
# number = int(user_input)  
# print(f"You entered: {number}")

# Example 3
# numerator = 10
# denominator = 0
# result = numerator / denominator  
# print(result)

# Example 4
# result = "Hello" + 5 
# print(result)
